Hello Odin!

UPDATE (4/30):

Having started the CSS part of the Odin Project, I want to try and flex my brain a little and keep testing things out. I have a feeling the project might revisit the recipe repo (if it doesn't, I'm sure I'll tinker at some point), so I want to set up just a random site to test out some styling.
